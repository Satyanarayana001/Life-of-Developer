## 📖 Project Description
 
This project is a fully immersive, scroll-driven storytelling experience that chronicles the humorous and deeply relatable journey of a developer — from typing their first `<h1>` tag to shipping code into production at 3AM with shaking, caffeine-fueled hands.
 
The experience opens with a terminal boot sequence — **ODYSSEY_OS v1.0.4** — that immediately signals this is not a conventional submission. Users explore seven narrative chapters across a dark, CRT-aesthetic interface: *The Awakening* (first HTML), *The Regression* (debugging hell with a live animating bug counter), *The Terminal* (a fully functional interactive shell), *The Compression* (expandable git commit cards with escalating desperation), *PR Merged* (the triumphant milestone), and *System Ready for Deploy* (the cinematic finale).

## 🗂️ Story Structure (7 Sections)
 
| # | Section | Narrative Role |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 0 | `Hero` | Boot screen + entry point |
| 1 | `Learning HTML` | The Awakening — first `<h1>` |
| 2 | `Debugging` | The Regression — bug hell, 404 errors |
| 3 | `Terminal` | The Console — interactive shell |
| 4 | `Deadlines` | The Compression — 3AM git commits |
| 5 | `PR Merged` | The Victory — first contribution |
| 6 | `Production` | The Deploy — ship it to the universe |
